# MyGrep
master/mygrep.exe
There are both release standalone application and a textfile with sample text in main folder,
so you can check if it works by launching mygrep.exe in main folder.
Old debug version with dynamic runtime libraries is located at master/x64/Debug,
it can not work on other machines so I made that release standalone version.
Project files are somewhere in master/Mygrep.
.vs folder cannot be fetched by GitHub, so I left it untracked. Hope it isn't so important.
